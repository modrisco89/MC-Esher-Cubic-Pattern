Part A - Mark (5 /5)
-----------------------------

Comments - 1/1
indente/formatted - 1/1 
naming - 1/1
includsion of Readme - 1/1 
includsion of Reflection - 1/1

Having reviewed my assignment, I've incleded everything required for part A,
I made sure to include detailed comments on how it works, indented correctly, all naming aligned with mentioned rules
Readme and reflection complete.
I am recording 5/5 or 100%


Part B - Mark (2 /2)
-----------------------------

Sizing.
line 31
I have sized the display window correctly so 2/2. 100%


Part C - Mark (5 /5)
-----------------------------
line 37 - draw() 
line 30 - setup()

Both Included, both executing code, 5/5 or 100%


Part D - Mark (10 /10)
-----------------------------
Use of if statements:

line 47 shows an example of an if statement
line 159 to 257 shows an example of branching
line 140 to 147 involves a nested if
I have multiple examples of if statements, nested if statements and branching
I believe I demonstrated my understanding of if statements clearly 10/10 or 100%

Part E - Mark (20 /20)
-----------------------------
Use of loops:

for loops used on: 
269 in drawCube method

use of while loop on:
314 in drawSmallcube Method

line 285 to 306 uses a nested for loop
line 333 to 356 uses a nested While

I have multiple examples of loops used, including at least
2 (for and while) and nested for and while

I give myself 20/20 or 100%


Part F - Mark (13.8 /20)
-----------------------------
Use of bespokes method 

line 58 keySettings method is set up (no parameter no return value)
line 116 and 128 demonstrate method overloading (colourFlags)
line 269 demonstates a method being used (drawCube) (no parameter no return value)
Line 314 demonstrates a method being used (drawSmallCube) (no parameter no return value)
Line 364 demonstrates a method being used (RandomColours) (no parameter no return value)
Line 377 demonstates a method being used (transitionBw) (no parameter no return value)
all are called throughout the code

3+ bespoke methods included and called. But none use a return value

So I give myself 13.8/20 or 69%

I'm giving this mark to myself because I believe I used the methods very well to shorten the code.


Part G - Mark (10 /10)
-----------------------------
Use of Processing methods 

line 373 random() is used
line 353 triangle() is used
line 347 fill() is used
line 342 noStroke() is used
line 264 textSize() is used
line 265 text() is used
line 146 background() is used
line 32 frameRate() is used

I give myself excellent, since multiple processing methods were used.
10/10 or 100%

Part H - Mark (6.9 /10)
-----------------------------
Use of Mouse methods 

line 46 mousePressed() was used
line 138 mouseClicked() was used

keyPressed and keyReleased are not mouse methods but they do
work with mousedPressed and MouseClicked to give the user more control
I give myself very good since they are all integrated meaningfully into the
project, I give myself 6.9/10 or 69%

Part I - Mark (4 /10)
-----------------------------
Use of String methods 

line 50 toUpperCase() is called
line 50 toLowerCase() is called
These are the only two used so I give myself a good
I felt with the user controls I have already
Use of any more string methods wouldn't fit well into this project

I give myself 4/10 or 40%


Part J - Mark (3 /3)
-----------------------------
Saving as a .PNG 

line 50 shows how the .PNG file is saved when the mouse is right pressed (preferred mousepressed over right click)
use of mousepressed prevents saving in error as right click is so sensitive, use of mousepressed sort of prevents this.
I give myself 3/3 or 100%

Part k - Mark (5 /5)
-----------------------------
My piece is an MC Esher inspired work, containing 2 different verions, one with cubes, another with cubes with a layer of small cubes.
Also, it shows different variations in Black & White or random colours, executing these methods at different stages to produce different results.
Use of triangles formed together to form the cubes along with colouring gives a 3D effect.
It's interactive giving the user control of cycling through different images, saving an image, showing a dialog box for instructions and upon saving and control of distortion.
It can save multiple images per different variation, even along with the variation number.
I may have only used triangles, but this took a while to create the 1st shape as triangles are trickier to use than the rest of the shapes, and have them stagger every second row.
Especially when I added the smaller cubes layer on top.
I give myself 5/5 or 100%

TOTAL =5+2+5+10+20+13.8+10+6.9+4+3+5 = 84.7
