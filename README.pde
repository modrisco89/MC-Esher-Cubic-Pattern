Brief description of piece:
6 triangles put together to form 2 types of cubic pattern with varying colours and distortion at the users control
Instructions on user controls presented upon opening.
Instructions presented at the at the bottom of this README file if required


Right click on any image to save
Note: Blank gray image at the start or end cannot be saved

Known bugs/problems:
Distortion only works with Standard and Standard 2, with other types of images it caused it randomise the colour again when the key was pressed after the mouse had been clicked.
So I removed the capability to distort any image and only for the standard images.
Colour randomises with every left click, this is good and bad, the only problem is you won't be able to get back a favorite image as it is forever changing with clicks
